##A bulk image resizer with Tkinter GUI

This project was started in mind to learn about Python and Tkinter in general. Looking back at this project, the code is pretty awful and unmaintainable.

###Main take aways:
* GUI programming is not my slice cup of teacake. I am horrible at it
* Don't go egotripping in the future with your code, use variable declarations that make sense
* Don't go egotripping in the future with your code, if/elsing away is way better than absolutely nightmare inducing ternary abominations
* Python threading is a complete joke. Concurrent image resizing? How about 50% performance decline in return. What?

The program works and does what it is supposed to do (and is pretty fast too), but i have no interest in upkeeping this mess. Fork and refactor the living out of this if you wish. Or just use it to resize your images.
