BUGS:
#ProcessWindow columns spans too wide when resizing images and changing the label
#Output filenames are not same as original filenames, but 1,2,3,4.....
#Multithreading is broken beyond belief
#Multithreading freezes the UI windows when finished resizing
Select all button in mainwindow, can not proceed to resizing after selecting all --FIXED


IMPROVEMENTS:
#Input/Output path shown in mainwindow
#More space to show input/output filenames
