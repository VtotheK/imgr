BUGS:
#ProcessWindow columns spans too wide when resizing images and changing the label
#Output filenames are not same as original filenames, but 1,2,3,4.....
#Multithreading is broken beyond belief
#Multithreading freezes the UI windows when finished resizing
#Select all button in mainwindow, can not proceed to resizing after selecting all


IMPROVEMENTS:
#Input/Output path shown in mainwindow
More space to show input/output filenames
GUI is broken beyond belief, needs serious refactoring. More frames, the freaking image/non-image listboxes are on a single frame and
it renders the whole right side of the screen impossible to program.
